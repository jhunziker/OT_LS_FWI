% This function interpolates the electrical property matrix A (having row and column position
% vectors x and z, respectively) to form the matrix A2 (having row and column position vectors
% x2 and z2, respectively).  The interpolation method by default is nearest neighbour ('nearest').  
% Otherwise the method can be specified as 'linear', 'cubic', or 'spline'.
