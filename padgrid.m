% This function pads the electrical property matrix A (having row and column position vectors
% x and z, respectively) with n elements around each side to create the matrix A2 (having row
% and column position vectors x2 and z2, respectively).  The properties in the padded regions
% are simply the properties of the original matrix extended outwards.
